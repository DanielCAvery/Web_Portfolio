					<h3>About Daniel C. Avery</h3>
					
					<p>Hey, I'm Daniel! Welcome to my portfolio. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
					
					<p>I’ve built websites/blogs in HTML, CSS and Photoshop since 2008 and I’ve done temp/freelance work ever since. Now that I’ve finished school, I’m transitioning to full time work. Past employers consistently commend me on the tech issues solved and the polished image brought to their organizations.</p>
					
					<p>I've worked on successful sites that made money and sites that were total failures. I've graduated from "Film School" and Business School, and in both places, I learned how important it is to build great websites, and I'm now transitioning to web and UI development full time while taking online courses and bootcamps through Udemy and Treehouse.</p>
					
					<p>I am currently looking at web and UI development positions throughout the U.S. as I finish up my latest course, which is an online bootcamp from Udemy in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Semantic UI, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB and RESTful routing. My next goal is to learn Angular and best practices in MEAN stack development.</p>

					<h3 class="body-title">SEO & Internet Marketing</h3>
					
					<p>I've been studying SEO (search engine optimization), SEM (search engine marketing), 
					SMM (social media marketing) and other internet marketing studies since
					January 2015. One thing is for sure, this is a fast-moving area of the web! 
					I've learned quite a lot from my personal studies, college projects and the 
					consulting I've done. Here's my opinion at this point:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Google AdWords and other PPC (pay per click) systems do not work as well as they would like you to believe.</li>
					
						<li>The best way to get real internet traffic and long-term SEO is through: 
						<ol>
							<li>Proper use of Title tags</li>
							<li>Proper use of Meta Description tags</li>
							<li>Good content people want, with keywords throughout, but only where it makes sense. Blogging is a good way to do this</li>
							<li>Managing your links: both the links to your site and the links away from your site</li>
						</ol></li>
						
						<li>As part of managing your links and creating great content, you will need to use social media, including YouTube or Vimeo to create a Google trail.</li>
						<li>Hopefully, you can also see then that content marketing, or copywriting is crucial. Writing is important both for SEO, as well as design and development.</li>
						<li>You will also need to either create a smart affiliate marketing model or else build an email list. You may need to do both.</li>
						<li>You need to constantly and consistently analyze the results you're getting or it does no good. Google Analytics is a great tool for this.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>I am certified in Google Analytics (the thumbnail above is a photo of my official certificate from Google), have received commendations on my copywriting, have produced YouTube marketing videos for a few small businesses, and have studied social media marketing.
					As I work on your site, I will keep in mind the marketing/SEO side of things as well and design in a way that will help you market your site effectively.</p>
